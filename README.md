# Software-Design-Project

Our final project for the Software Design class at the University of Houston.

This is a PHP & MySQL MVC web app that generates and stores a fuel delivery quote based on customer history, location, and gallons requested.

Developing this project, I learned PHP authentication and authorization, cookie storing and retrieval, MySQL backend routing and management, and AWS PHP app deployment.

The most difficult portion of this project was getting the PHPUnit and PHP-code-coverage modules to function properly and produce a code coverage report.
